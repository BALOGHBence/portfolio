Me as an Educator
=================

I have tremendous amount of experience in education in teachning university and PhD level solid mechanics.
As a PhD student, I was responsible for teaching the following subjects:

* Basics of Statics (BSc) and Dynamics in Hungarian.
* Strength of Materials (BSc) in Hungarian.
* Nonlinear Mechanics (MSc) in English. This is actually a PhD level course.

Besides teachning, I crated high quality lecture notes, homeworks, exams and solutions for the above subjects.

Since I've left the university, I take students on a private basis, one at a time, teaching various subjects in 
both structural and mechanical engineering.

Check out a few from the lecture notes I've written by clicking on the buttons below. If you do so, consider that I wrote
these at a time when I had a 300 EUR/month (no typo there) sarary as a PhD student (the amount has not changed since then).
