Me as a Structural Engineer
===========================

This probably doesn't require too much explanation. I've experience with concrete, steel, timber
and composite structures, and I've worked on a wide range of projects, including bridges and buildings, 
and I've also took part in the development of a catamaran. I also posess excellent, PhD level theoretical
understanding of structural mechanics, and the finite element method, for which I developed my own
library in Python. I also have experience with professional software like AxisVM or ANSYS.

Although I don't have a tremendous amount of practical experience, I make up for it with my theoretical
expertise and my ability to create custom software solutions for complex engineering problems. I'm known
about being able to tackle the most complicated of problems and my clients usually approach me with tasks
others struggle to solve.

When should you hire me as a structural engineer? If you have a complex problem that requires a custom
solution, out-of-box thinking I'm your guy. If you need a software solution for a problem that is not covered 
by existing software, I'm your guy. If you need a reliable, accurate and fast solution for a problem that is
beyond the capabilities of existing software, I'm your guy.
