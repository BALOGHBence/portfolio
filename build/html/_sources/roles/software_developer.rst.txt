Me as a Software Developer
===========================

I have extensive experience in software development and have worked on a diverse array of projects. My portfolio includes 
applications for both desktop and web, developed using various programming languages and frameworks. While I have a 
strong background in Python, I also have experience in Fortran, Visual Basic, C#, C++, HTML, CSS, and Delphi. Additionally, 
I have experience with specialized languages such as ANSYS APDL, LaTeX, and MATLAB.

Throughout my career, I have worked with a wide range of programming languages, from strongly typed, compiled languages 
with rigorous memory management like Delphi to high-level, dynamic, interpreted languages like Python. This broad experience 
enables me to identify and utilize the perfect set of tools for a given problem, ensuring optimal solutions. My ability to 
quickly learn and adapt to new languages and frameworks means that learning a new language for a project is no problem for me. 
Employers can be confident that even if I am not already familiar with a specific framework they are looking for, I can quickly 
get up to speed and deliver high-quality results.

I have several years of experience in developing, managing, maintaining, documenting and deploying software applications.
I'm the founder and maintainer of several professional Python packages, where I currently do all the development, testing, 
documentation and DevOps duties.

Although in the past couple of years my attention shifted towards high level languages and web, I have several years of
experience if developing industry level desktop applications with over 5 million lines of code.

I'm familiar with OOP, design patterns, SOLID principles, algorithm design, software architecture, and version control sistems 
such as Git and SVN, and more.
