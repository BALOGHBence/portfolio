========================
Me as a Technical Writer
========================

I have experience in technical writing, as I have written several scientific papers, a PhD thesis, and
I have created the documentation for several software packages. I have experience with LaTeX, Sphinx, and
Markdown, MS Office, Google Docs and I have created documentation in all of these formats.

For examples, check out the following projects:

* :ref:`Research and Software Implementation of a Novel Design Module for Multi-Layered Composite Shells in AxisVM`
  
  The official documentation of the design module is a great example. The document was written
  in :math:`\LaTeX`.

* :ref:`Development of a Scientific Research Toolkit in Python Including a Finite Element and a Tensor Algebra Library`
    
  All the documentation of the libraries mentioned in the projects were written by me using
  the same tech stack I used to write this webpage.

You can also explore my community articles on Medium (`click here <https://medium.com/@bencebalogh_33809>`_),
take a look at my articles published in the best scientific journals (:ref:`Publications`) or check out my
lecture notes I created for my stufents: (:ref:`Me as an Educator`).
