Overview
========

I spearheaded the development of a REST API backend for a Tender Evaluator Platform, a web-based application aimed at 
streamlining the evaluation process for construction project tenders. This platform enables users to create, manage, 
and evaluate tenders collaboratively and efficiently. Built using Django, a high-level Python web framework, the backend 
offers a robust and scalable architecture capable of handling the platform's complex business logic. For the database, 
we utilized PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system.
   
Responsibilities
================

- **Project Management and Leadership:** I was responsible for managing the development process, including planning, scheduling, 
  and tracking progress. I worked closely with the team to ensure that the project was delivered on time and within budget.
- **Backend Development:** I led the development of the REST API backend, including designing the architecture, implementing
  the business logic, and optimizing performance. I also worked on integrating third-party services and tools to enhance the
  functionality of the platform.
- **Contacting with Customers:** I was responsible for communicating with the customers to gather requirements, provide updates,
  and address any issues or concerns. I also conducted user testing and feedback sessions to ensure that the platform met the
  needs of the users.
- **Documentation:** I created detailed the user guide for the platform. This document guided the users through the process of
  creating and managing projects, evaluating applications, and generating reports. I also provided technical documentation for
  the REST API endpoints to help developers integrate the platform with other systems.

Features
========

- **Defining and Managing Projects:** On the platform, users can log in and manage projects according to their roles and
  responsibilities. They can create new projects, assign team members, set deadlines, and track progress.
- **Evaluating Applications:** The platform includes a business analytics dashboard to support the decision making process.
  The users can compare applications and detact anomalies in the data, including signs of cartelling.
- **Email Notification System**: The platform includes an email notification system to keep users informed about project updates,
  deadlines, and other important events.

Technologies Used
=================

- **Python:** Core programming language for developing the backend.
- **Django REST Framework:** Used to build the REST API endpoints and handle requests and responses.
- **PostgreSQL:** Database management system for storing and retrieving data.
- **Docker:** Used for containerization and deployment of the application.
- **Git:** Version control system for managing the codebase and collaborating with the team.
- **Agile Methodology:** Used for project management and development process.
- **Plotly Dash:** Used for creating interactive data visualizations in the business analytics dashboard.

Challenges and Solutions
========================

- **Huge Amounts of Data:** I wouldn't saz big data, but the number of items in a typical tender is well in the thousands.
  The data was provided in Excel files, which had to be imported into the database. I developed a custom data import mechanism
  to categorize items and map them to the database schema. This involved data cleaning, validation, and transformation to ensure
  the integrity and consistency of the data.
- **Anomaly Detection:** For the analytics dashboard, I had to come up with.
- **User Guide:** Creating the detailed user guide was a challenge on its own. I had to ensure that the instructions were clear,
  concise, and easy to follow. I also included screenshots and examples to help users understand the functionality of the platform.

Conclusion
==========

The development of the REST API backend for the Tender Evaluator Platform was a challenging and rewarding experience. I gained
valuable insights into project management, backend development, and customer communication. The platform has been well-received
by the users and has helped streamline the tender evaluation process. I am proud of the work that I have done and look forward
to taking on new similar challenges in the future.
