Since you are here, I assume you are an HR manager looking for a specific skillset.
I hope you will find what you are looking for, but there are a couple of things you should know about me
and although this is not a bio, some introduction is required. I think that if you invest a little time in
reading the next few lines, you will have a much better understanding of who I am and what I can offer.

A brief introduction
====================

I've started my educational journey in the field of civil engineering, and I finished my BSc studies at the
Budapest University of Technology and Economics. I completed two majors, one in bridge design and another one in
high-rise building design. What set me apart was my deep interest in not just the design procedures of structures,
but the physics behind them. I was always interested in the way things work, and I was always eager to learn more.
Also, I was interested in modern, computational solutions and I had an appetite for programming as well.
All of this has led me to apply for a masters degree in the field of Computational Structural Mechanics,
organized by the Department of Structural Mechanics. This was a turning point in my life, as I was introduced to
the world of programming, numerical methods, and the power of computational solutions. I was fascinated by the
possibilities and the potential of these tools, and I knew that this was the path I wanted to follow. The subjects
were challenging, full of advanced mathematics and physics, but I was determined to learn as much as I could. During
this period, I was also introduced to the world of scientific research, as I participated in the yearly research
contest organized by the faculty, and I was awarded the 3rd prize in my category. My work was about creating
software implementation for the calculation of all kinds of composite plates, which required me to learn programming
on my own. In my master's thesis I pulled off a similar feat, only the topic was different. The domain was the same: 
theoretical mechanics combined with software development. There was no turning back, I felt like I've found my passion. 
After the master's degree, I applied for a PhD position at the same department, and I was accepted. While applying to the 
doctoral school, I achieved a perfect score on the mathematics entrance exam, an accomplishment that, to my knowledge, 
few have achieved before me. My research topic was about Structural Topology Optimiyation, which is a hot blend of
structural mechanics, optimization, and programming. I was working on the development of a software that could solve
the topology optimization problem for 3D structures. This was a challenging task, as the problem is highly nonlinear,
and the solution requires advanced mathematical methods and also a deep understanding of theoretical solid mechanics.
This puts me in a unique position, as I have a deep understanding of both the theoretical and the computational aspects,
supplemented with a strong background in software development. However, the situation has downsides as well, as I struggle
to explain who I exactly am and what I can offer in a few sentences. To simply say I'm a civil engineer, would be an understatement. 
I also wouldn't say I'm a physicist, a mathematician, a software developer, a ML engineer, an optimization engineer or a data scientist 
either, but still, I'm a little bit all of these. This is why I'm writing this introduction, to give you a better understanding of 
my background and my capabilities. I hope you will find this information useful, and I hope that you will find what you are 
looking for in my portfolio. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, I'm always happy to help.
