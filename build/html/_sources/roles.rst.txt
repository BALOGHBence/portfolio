Roles
=====

This section explains how I fit into the roles of a structural engineer, data scientist, 
software developer, optimization engineer or researcher.

Me as a Structural Engineer
===========================

This probably doesn't require too much explanation. I've experience with concrete, steel, timber
and composite structures, and I've worked on a wide range of projects, including bridges and buildings, 
and I've also took part in the development of a catamaran. I also posess excellent, PhD level theoretical
understanding of structural mechanics, and the finite element method, for which I developed my own
library in Python. I also have experience with professional software like AxisVM or ANSYS.

Although I don't have a tremendous amount of practical experience, I make up for it with my theoretical
expertise and my ability to create custom software solutions for complex engineering problems. I'm known
about being able to tackle the most complicated of problems and my clients usually approach me with tasks
others struggle to solve.

When should you hire me as a structural engineer? If you have a complex problem that requires a custom
solution, out-of-box thinking I'm your guy. If you need a software solution for a problem that is not covered 
by existing software, I'm your guy. If you need a reliable, accurate and fast solution for a problem that is
beyond the capabilities of existing software, I'm your guy.

Me as a Software Developer
==========================

I have extensive experience in software development and have worked on a diverse array of projects. My portfolio includes 
applications for both desktop and web, developed using various programming languages and frameworks. While I have a 
strong background in Python, I also have experience in Fortran, Visual Basic, C#, C++, HTML, CSS, and Delphi. Additionally, 
I have experience with specialized languages such as ANSYS APDL, LaTeX, and MATLAB.

Throughout my career, I have worked with a wide range of programming languages, from strongly typed, compiled languages 
with rigorous memory management like Delphi to high-level, dynamic, interpreted languages like Python. This broad experience 
enables me to identify and utilize the perfect set of tools for a given problem, ensuring optimal solutions. My ability to 
quickly learn and adapt to new languages and frameworks means that learning a new language for a project is no problem for me. 
Employers can be confident that even if I am not already familiar with a specific framework they are looking for, I can quickly 
get up to speed and deliver high-quality results.

I have several years of experience in developing, managing, maintaining, documenting and deploying software applications.
I'm the founder and maintainer of several professional Python packages, where I currently do all the development, testing, 
documentation and DevOps duties.

Although in the past couple of years my attention shifted towards high level languages and web, I have several years of
experience if developing industry level desktop applications with over 5 million lines of code.

I'm familiar with OOP, design patterns, SOLID principles, algorithm design, software architecture, and version control sistems 
such as Git and SVN, and more.

Me as an Optimization Engineer
==============================

I was introduced to the field of optimization during my PhD studies, where I focused on the optimal design of structures. 
This work required not only a solid understanding of solid mechanics but also a deep knowledge of optimization algorithms, 
both theoretical and practical. I have experience with gradient-based and gradient-free optimization algorithms, heuristic 
and path-following methods, and linear and nonlinear, as well as integer and real-valued optimization problems.

During my PhD, I developed a custom optimization algorithm to solve the topology optimization problem, a highly nonlinear, 
mixed-integer optimization challenge with PDE constraints. This problem is beyond the capabilities of even advanced libraries 
like Gurobi or CPLEX, necessitating a deep understanding of the problem and the ability to create a custom solution. My algorithm 
for finding optimal topologies required a thorough comprehension of the problem's unique properties, allowing me to craft 
domain-specific solutions that leverage these characteristics. I believe that this specialized knowledge is far more valuable 
than simply knowing how to use existing libraries.

The algorithms I've implemented myself so far are:

* A graph theory-based optimization algorithm to minimize the bandwidth of the coefficient matrix in a finite element software.

* A genetic algorithm for general purpose nonlinear optimization.

* A solve for linear programming problems (LPP) of all kinds.

* A topology optimization algorithm using an Optimality Criteria Method (OC) using the SIMP approach for:
  
  * Finding the optimal topology of general structures for minimum volume, subject to an upper bound
    constraint on the work of external forces, a PDE constraint expressing the equilibrium,
    and an upper bound constraint on the utilization of the structure.
  
  * Finding the optimal topology of general structures for maximum stiffness, subject to an upper bound
    constraint on the volume, a PDE constraint expressing the equilibrium,
    and an upper bound constraint on the utilization of the structure.

* A shape optimization algorithm to optimize various kinds of curved-folded structures using the
  Finite Strip Method (FSM) for minimum weight, subject to an upper bound constraint on the volume,
  a PDE constraint expressing the equilibrium of the strucrure.

Me as a Data Scientist
======================

Me as a Researcher
==================

Most of my projects on this site involved some kind of research, where I had to develop a custom solution 
for a complex engineering problem. I have experience with both theoretical and practical research, and I 
have a strong background in solid mechanics, mathematics. Exemple projects:

* :ref:`Theoretical Development and Software Implementation of an Asymptotic Homogenization Method in Delphi`

* :ref:`Research and Software Implementation of a Novel Design Module for Multi-Layered Composite Shells in AxisVM`

I also have experience in academic research, as I was a PhD student for 4 years, where I worked on some of the 
open challenges of structural topology optimization. This work required a deep understanding of the theoretical 
aspects of structural mechanics and applied mathematics, as well as the ability to develop a custom software 
implementation.

Me as an Educator
=================

I have tremendous amount of experience in education in teachning university and PhD level solid mechanics.
As a PhD student, I was responsible for teaching the following subjects:

* Basics of Statics (BSc) and Dynamics in Hungarian.
* Strength of Materials (BSc) in Hungarian.
* Nonlinear Mechanics (MSc) in English. This is actually a PhD level course.

Besides teachning, I crated high quality lecture notes, homeworks, exams and solutions for the above subjects.

Me as a Technical Writer
========================

I have experience in technical writing, as I have written several scientific papers, a PhD thesis, and
I have created the documentation for several software packages. I have experience with LaTeX, Sphinx, and
Markdown, MS Office, Google Docs and I have created documentation in all of these formats.
