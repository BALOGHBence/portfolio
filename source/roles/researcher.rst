==================
Me as a Researcher
==================

Most of my projects on this site involved some kind of research, where I had to develop a custom solution 
for a complex engineering problem. I have experience with both theoretical and practical research, and I 
have a strong background in solid mechanics and mathematics. Exemple projects:

* :ref:`Theoretical Development and Software Implementation of an Asymptotic Homogenization Method in Delphi`

* :ref:`Research and Software Implementation of a Novel Design Module for Multi-Layered Composite Shells in AxisVM`

I also have experience in academic research, as I was a PhD student for 4 years, where I worked on some of the 
open challenges of structural topology optimization. This work required a deep understanding of the theoretical 
aspects of structural mechanics and applied mathematics, as well as the ability to develop a custom software 
implementation.
